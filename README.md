# Streamlining Data process of the Mopup
This is a repository for all the code that has to do with thr data process streaming we have discussed on Friday April 11th. 

Currently our approaches is
* script download from formhub into csvs
* break the csvs down to LGA level
* reuse the original R pipeline for each smaller subset for smaller memory footprint
